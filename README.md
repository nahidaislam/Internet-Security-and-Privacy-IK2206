A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is used for secure extension of a private network over an insecure network,such as the Internet. You can think of a VPN as a secure link,tunnel, established over a public infrastructure.There are many different protocols that can be used for secure VPNs.  In this project, we will use SecureSocket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS), for simplicity just referred to as “SSL”.The learning objective of this project is for students to master the network and security technologiesunderlying SSL VPNs, and to gain insight into the general principles for VPNs. The design and implemen-tation of SSL VPNs exemplify a number of security principles and technologies, including cryptography,authentication, key management, key exchange, and public-key infrastructures.
